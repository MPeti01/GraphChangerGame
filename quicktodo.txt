Small things whenever
=======================
- More HP for Node (esp level 1) when owned by player than when uncaptured
- Better PartialEdge unit collision detection
- Random movement of Units when standing
- Don't let the two games get too much time apart and crash

Kinda mid-long term bigger stuff
================================
- Levelgen
    - Spawn upgraded neutral nodes as well
    - Spawn with prebuilt graph stuff?
- EdgeHandler, EdgeBuilder could reaaally do with a big refactor
- Think of how single player should be handled, where to connect
  the AI to the system, what should happen to the network classes
  and their pretty tight integration as it is atm


Reeeally long term reeeeallly big stuff
=======================================
- Graphics
- Menu + UI
- AI
