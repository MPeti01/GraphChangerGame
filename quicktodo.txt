Reeeally long term reeeeallly big stuff
=======================================
- Graphics
- Menu + UI
- AI


Kinda mid-long term bigger stuff
================================
- Levelgen
    - Spawn upgraded neutral nodes as well
    - Spawn with prebuilt graph stuff?


Bigger things kinda next
========================
- Edge contesting
    - Able to turn built edges
    - 0% edges visible easily somehow
    - Even if a contest-edge is down to 0%, try to rebuild until cancelled or 100%
    - Full Edges can exist fine if there's a 0% PartialEdge against them.
      They are replaced with PartialEdges when they are "decreased"
- Priorities:
    - Defend Node
    - Fight for contested edges
        - Spread equally!
    - Upgrade
    - Build uncontested edges
        - Sequentially? Meh, their fault maybe?
        - Only send the number of units actually needed


Small things whenever
=======================
- Restart..
- Random movement of Units when standing
- Safer PartialEdge unit collision detection (see TODO)
- Threads..
    - Stop read thread when game is over
    - Listen, connect in separate threads
