Directly next up
================
- Clean up state stuff
    - Some logging would be nice
    - Either don't pass GS to the states or don't have them store it
    - If they store it, move it to a superclass
    - Maybe move some of the inputs to a superclass as well
    - Figure out some place for comm protocol values


Small things whenever
=======================
- Random movement of Units when standing
- Safer PartialEdge unit collision detection (see TODO)


Bigger things kinda next
========================
- Edge contesting
    - Able to turn built edges
    - 0% edges visible easily somehow
    - Even if a contest-edge is down to 0%, try to rebuild until cancelled or 100%
    - Full Edges can exist fine if there's a 0% PartialEdge against them.
      They are replaced with PartialEdges when they are "decreased"
- Priorities:
    - Defend Node
    - Fight for contested edges
        - Spread equally!
    - Upgrade
    - Build uncontested edges
        - Sequentially? Meh, their fault maybe?
        - Only send the number of units actually needed


Kinda mid-long term bigger stuff
================================
- Levelgen
    - Spawn upgraded neutral nodes as well
    - Spawn with prebuilt graph stuff?
- Don't let the two games get too much time apart and crash
- Think of how single player should be handled, where to connect
  the AI to the system, what should happen to the network classes
  and their pretty tight integration as it is atm


Reeeally long term reeeeallly big stuff
=======================================
- Graphics
- Menu + UI
- AI
