=======
- Implement pregame states and transitions
    - Create simple SPSS
    - Extract MPSS from current StartingState
        - MPCS should create NC, MPSS can use that
        - Choose the levels, create loader
    - GameScreen modifications
        - No SS; create GC in ctor
        - Switch to MPSyncPhase if MP
        - Then (or if SP, right away) CountdownPhase
        - Then PLAY!

- Create place for AI
    - Connection (some better name would be nice?) as interface
        - AIConnection to mediate between game and AI core or whatever
        - Current connection as RemoteConnection or sth
    - GC needs to receive a notnull connection, not a nullable netcomm
        - GS has to create that. Could do with some parameters
        - For now, just "new AIConnection(new AICore())" or sth?


Small things whenever
=======================
- More commenting using stats plugin to notice 0% files.. :)

Kinda mid-long term bigger stuff
================================
- Unit rendering stuff
    - Fade in and out
    - Group + count
- Multilevel LevelLoader
- Levelgen
    - Spawn upgraded neutral nodes as well
    - Spawn with prebuilt graph stuff?
- EdgeHandler, EdgeBuilder could reaaally do with a big refactor
    (probably never gonna happen...)


Reeeally long term reeeeallly big stuff
