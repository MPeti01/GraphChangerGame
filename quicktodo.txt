=======================
- Random movement of Units when standing
- More commenting using stats plugin to notice 0% files.. :)
- Make starting local MP easier with .bat?
- Missing graphics
    - Node upgrading
    - Long edges "falling apart"
    - Unit consume fadeout

Kinda mid-long term bigger stuff
================================
- Levelgen
    - Spawn upgraded neutral nodes as well
    - Spawn with prebuilt graph stuff?
- EdgeHandler, EdgeBuilder could reaaally do with a big refactor
- Think of how single player should be handled, where to connect
  the AI to the system, what should happen to the network classes
  and their pretty tight integration as it is atm
